SHORT TERM:

*  Add full checks for SRV, PTR, RP, and NAPTR to 'mydnscheck'.

*  Reply cache should obey shortest TTL in the cached RRSET.



LONG TERM:

*	Move SRV/RP/NAPTR extra data OUT of the mydns_rr structure -- leave the
	data in the "data" column and let it be parsed as needed.  The parsed
	data really gobbles up space in the MYDNS_RR structure. - almost done

*	Full IPv6 support (added to server, need support in utils).

*	Update manual:
	- How delegation works.

*	LOC (RFC 1876?) support.

*	Make sure we're NEVER using inet_ntoa, inet_addr, etc.

*	Fix in_cidr to work with IPv6 addresses.

*	Test AXFR from an IPv6 master via `mydns-import'.

*	Investigate linker problem with `-ffast-math' on FreeBSD/alpha:

		/usr/lib/crtfastmath.o: In function `set_fast_math':
		/usr/lib/crtfastmath.o(.text+0x1c): undefined reference to
			`__ieee_set_fp_control'

*	No calls to gethostbyname() anywhere -- add `--enable-static-build'
	back to the `./configure' line in pkg/mydns-mysql.spec.in.

*	Extend record sizes to 65535 limit - auxiliary data table needed

*	Add additional record types

*	Rewrite DB abstrction to remove sql from main line code

*	Run-time DB switch so that can support multiple DB's
	 e.g MyDNS and Postgresql at the same time.

*	Add an acl table to support symbolic acl's

*	Add TSIG capabilities

*	Add DNSSEC

*	Add notify processing on receipt of notify
	- flush other server process caches
	- check SOA against master (if slave)
	- check SOA against db and force reload

*	Add other zone types
	- Master, Slave, Forward, Stub

*	Add code to support transfer in (mydnsimport) using both AXFR and IXFR

*	Abstract memory management

*	Add additional statistics 

*	Add facility to collect statistics in master process and report.

*	Add a command interface
	- collect qstats on demand
	- force zone reload
	- force zone flush
	- force slave(s) shutdown
	- force slave(s) startup
	- force notify transmission.

Additional things to look at.

*	Add views to the code?
