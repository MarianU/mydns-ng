Description: DNS server using MySQL for data storage
 Free DNS server for UNIX implemented from scratch and designed to
 utilise the MySQL database for data storage.
 .
 Its primary objectives are stability, security, interoperability, and
 speed, though not necessarily in that order.
 .
 MyDNS does not include recursive name service, nor a resolver library.
 .
 It is primarily designed for organisations with many zones and/or
 resource records who desire the ability to perform real-time dynamic
 updates on their DNS data via MySQL.
